# Netlify Adapter v4 simplifies static + SSR deployments

This update is a complete overhaul of the Netlify adapter.
It simplifies the user-facing config, and resolves a number of bugs along the way.

Here's what changes:

## Netlify Context is automatically available via Locals

In v3, you could use `netlify-edge-middleware.ts` to inject data from the Netlify context into your Astro locals.
In v4, this file is no longer needed because the Netlify context is automatically made available via `Astro.locals.netlify.context`.
You can use this context to access information about the user (like geolocation or IP address), your Netlify site (like deploy ID) or the request (like its request ID or the CDN region it's served from).

**Action Required:**
Remove the `netlify-edge-middleware.ts` or `netlify-edge-middleware.js` file.
In your codebase, change all usage of locals injected through that file to use `Astro.locals.netlify.context` instead.

### Image CDN

v4 of this adapter integrates your Astro site with Netlify [Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/image-cdn/overview/).
This allows transforming images on-the-fly without impacting build times.
It's implemented using an [Astro Image Service](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/image-service-reference/), and enabled by default.

## Replacement for On-Demand Builders

On-Demand Builders (ODB) allows SSR-Rendered pages to be cached using a Time to Live (TTL) strategy.
While the Netlify platform continues to support existing pages with ODBs, we now recommend using the much more powerful
[Fine-Grained Cache Control](https://www.netlify.com/blog/swr-and-fine-grained-cache-control) going forward.

In v3, you could deploy your SSR-Rendered Astro pages to ODBs by enabling the `builders` config option,
and then specifying the TTL on a per-page basis.
In v4, a new `cacheOnDemandPages` option replaces this config option. Take a look at the README to learn more about this.

**Action Required:**
Replace the `builders` config option with `cacheOnDemandPages`.

```diff lang="ts"
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  adapter: netlify({
-   builders: true
+   cacheOnDemandPages: true
  }),
});
```

## `functionPerRoute` was removed

In v3, the `functionPerRoute` option allowed the SSR routes to be split up into multiple Netlify Functions.
This reduced the bundle sizes of each individual function, with the intention of speeding up code parsing, and therefore the time of cold starts.
In practice, this benefit is often nullified by the increase in number of cold starts - more handlers means fewer requests per handler, means more cold starts.

In v4, support for this deployment mode was removed.

**Action Required:**
Remove the `functionPerRoute` field from your config.

## `binaryMediaTypes` was removed

`binaryMediaTypes` was a workaround required for some Astro endpoints, because v3 deployed those as "old" Netlify Functions (now referred to as ["Lambda Compatibility Mode"](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/lambda-compatibility)).
v4 uses the new [Netlify Functions 2.0](https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-netlify-functions-2-0/), which simply doesn't need this workaround anymore - so we're removing it ðŸŽ‰

**Action Required:**
Remove the `binaryMediaTypes` field from your config.
